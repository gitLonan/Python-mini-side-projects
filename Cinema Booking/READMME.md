# Welcome to CINEMA BOOKING

## Description

Cinema Booking is about scratching that itch and dopamin rush when you buy tickets for a new movie. First you'll not be loged in which means you are just a basic user(consumer), and you'll have some basic options.

  1. Show current hall
  2. Book a seat
  3. Book from the front
  4. Book from the back

Occupied and not occupied places will be represented by 1, 0 respectively. Ones that are coloured yellow represent current session bought tickets also options 3 and 4 are referred to first two sectors of the cinema hall, last one represents lovers sector. Basically it's for couples and anyone who wants to be alone.  
  
You can also log in (if you know the user name and password) and you'll get admin lvl access and be able to do diffrent things.
  1. Reset cinema hall
  2. Percentage of bought tickets
  3. Change row and col of cinema 
  4. Add another Admin account

All of them are pretty clear at what they do, just with the number 3, dont make it too big or it wont fit on the terminal screen and you'll
have to scroll to see it whole.

## Cinema at the beggining
At the start this is how it looks, except ones are coloured red and zeros are coloured green.   
First two sectors are regular ones but the third one is the famous lovers sector
